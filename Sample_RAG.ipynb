       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'sample.txt'}, page_content='Introduction to Data Science\\nData Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data. Data science is closely related to the fields of data mining, machine learning, and big data. The key components of data science include data collection, data cleaning, data analysis, and data visualization.\\n\\nData scientists use various tools such as Python, R, SQL, and cloud platforms to process large datasets and build models that help in decision-making. Popular libraries in Python used for data science include Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.\\n\\nKey Concepts in Machine Learning\\nMachine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. There are three main types of machine learning:\\n\\nSupervised Learning: In this type, the model is trained using labeled data. The goal is to map input to output based on the example input-output pairs.\\n\\nExample algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM).\\nUnsupervised Learning: In this type, the model is used to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in data that is not labeled.\\n\\nExample algorithms: K-means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA).\\nReinforcement Learning: Here, an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.\\n\\nExample algorithms: Q-Learning, Deep Q Networks (DQN).\\nIntroduction to Large Language Models (LLMs)\\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3, GPT-4, and LLaMA are advanced models trained on massive amounts of text data to generate human-like text based on input prompts. These models use transformer architecture and can perform various tasks, including question-answering, text generation, translation, summarization, and more.\\n\\nThe key advantage of LLMs is their ability to handle diverse tasks without needing task-specific training. They are pre-trained on vast corpora of text data and can be fine-tuned or used with techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to make their output more accurate and contextually relevant.\\n\\nVector Databases for Retrieval\\nIn the context of RAG, vector databases are used to store text as embeddings (vector representations). When a query is submitted, the system retrieves the most relevant embeddings based on similarity to the query, allowing the model to respond with the most pertinent information. Tools like FAISS, Pinecone, or Databricks Vector Search can be used for indexing and querying embeddings in a scalable manner.')]"

       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety-alternative-treatments'}, page_content='Limit your caffeine intakeThat morning cup of coffee might help you get out of bed, but having too much can give you the jitters and decrease your ability to handle anxiety well. A 2017 research review suggests some people can experience anxiety from consuming caffeine in amounts as low as 200 milligrams (mg) per day. This is the amount in about 2 cups of coffee. Most of the studies in this review involved people under psychiatric treatment or people with a preexisting anxiety disorder.Avoid alcohol and nicotineSome people use alcohol and nicotine to relieve symptoms of anxiety. This relief is only temporary, however. Alcohol and nicotine can make the symptoms of anxiety worse and more frequent.A 2019 study involving teenagers suggests that the use of alcohol and nicotine was associated with higher instances of mental health conditions. Those who used alcohol and nicotine were in more distress than those who did not.Eat a balanced dietA 2021 study suggests that following eating patterns that align with dietary recommendations and nutrient requirements may help prevent and treat depression and anxiety. The emerging field of nutritional psychiatry explores the relationships among nutrition, stress, mental health, and mental function.To help avoid anxiety, experts suggest the following dietary measures:Eat a well-balanced diet: Fill up with adequate fruits, vegetables, lean meats, and healthy fats.Avoid processed foods: Processed foods often contain minimal nutrition and harmful ingredients.Avoid foods high in sugar: A sugar rush can mimic or trigger a panic attack.Eat regular meals: Regular meals can help reduce low blood sugar, which can produce anxiety symptoms.Avoid sodas: Many sodas contain caffeine and have a high sugar content, both of which can contribute to anxiety.Avoid smoking: Nicotine can raise blood pressure and heart rate and mimic symptoms of anxiety.Drink more water: According to a 2018 study, drinking 6 to 8 large glasses of water or other hydrating liquids daily helps your body perform properly and can relieve stress.Get regular exerciseGetting regular exercise is good for relieving stress. Cardiovascular exercise has been shown to help lower stress levels and anxiety and improve immune system function.The Anxiety and Depression Association of America says even 5 minutes of aerobic exercise can begin to stimulate anti-anxiety effects. A 10-minute brisk walk can provide several hours of relief.Get plenty of sleepOne 2019 study found that sleep can help calm and reset an anxious brain. Try to get at least 6 to 8 hours of quality sleep every night. If you have trouble sleeping, try to support your body’s natural sleep schedule by:going to sleep and waking up at the same time each daytaking only short naps for 15 to 20 minutes in the early afternoon if you need toexposing yourself to bright sunlight in the morningspending more time outside during the day in natural lightavoiding bright screens 1 to 2 hours before bed and making sure you sleep in a darkened, cool roomgetting regular exercisePractice relaxation techniquesResearch shows that relaxation techniques can be a great way to reduce anxiety. Meditation, yoga, and breathing are a few techniques that can help with relaxing. Read on to see what relaxation techniques might work best for you.MeditationMeditation doesn’t change the world around you, but it can change the way you respond to it. Successful meditation can possibly help you better understand the source of your anxiety and overcome it.According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, studies and clinical trials suggest that meditation can help reduce anxiety and improve sleep. Meditation may even physically change the brain and body. This may help improve many physical and mental health issues.Breathing techniquesBreathing techniques can help you learn to control your breathing and may help prevent you from hyperventilating during an anxiety-producing event. This can help keep you calm.YogaYoga combines breathing techniques, meditation, and stretching through both moving and stationary postures.According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, yoga is one of the top 10 alternative practices used to treat a variety of disorders, including anxiety and depression. A 2018 study showed that 12 sessions of Hatha yoga exercise significantly reduced anxiety among study participants. Yoga also helped improve other health conditions, including stress and depression. Researchers recommended further investigation into yoga’s long-term effects.When you practice yoga regularly, you are more likely to experience its relaxing benefits. You can try following along to yoga videos at home or signing up for a yoga class.SupplementsStudies continue to examine the effects of herbal remedies to treat mild to moderate anxiety. While some research shows positive associations between the symptoms of anxiety and the use of certain herbs, there’s no strong evidence that herbal remedies are helpful for anxiety.If you have an anxiety disorder, it is important to use supplements only as additions to your primary treatment, not substitutions.Supplements are regulated by the FDA as food, not as drugs, which have stricter requirements. Any supplement that promises to improve or cure an anxiety disorder is going against FDA regulations.Always check with your doctor before starting any supplements. Some can have dangerous side effects or interact negatively with medications or health conditions. Also, some supplements are not safe during pregnancy.Nutritional supplements and herbs often used to relieve anxiety include:Vitamin B12: This vitamin plays a key role in the nervous system and may help reduce feelings of anxiety and depression.Chamomile: This herbal tea can have a soothing, anti-anxiety effect. A large 2016 clinical trial found that using chamomile long term significantly reduced moderate to severe generalized anxiety symptoms. However, it didn’t significantly lessen relapse.Passionflower: This is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States that was used as a sedative by Indigenous peoples. It is currently used to promote anxiety relief and sleep. According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, it hasn’t been studied enough to make conclusions about its effectiveness in reducing anxiety.L-theanine: This is an amino acid naturally found in green and black tea, as well as mushrooms. It is often taken as a supplement to reduce stress and anxiety. One 2019 clinical trial found that 4 weeks of use improved stress-related symptoms, such as anxiety and depression.Omega-3 fatty acids: Omega-3s are necessary for nervous system development. A 2018 research review of 19 studies found that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids significantly helped reduce anxiety symptoms.Essential oilsSome supplements, such as chamomile and valerian, are also available as essential oils that can be diffused and used as aromatics. Some research also shows evidence that lavender oil can be beneficial for anxiety disorders.CBD productsSome evidence supports the use of CBD products to help relieve anxiety symptoms, but there has not been a large amount of research on CBD and anxiety disorders.It’s also important to note that CBD products aren’t regulated by the FDA. If you choose to use CBD to help manage anxiety symptoms, make sure you are choosing a reputable brand. Is CBD legal? The 2018 Farm Bill removed hemp from the legal definition of marijuana in the Controlled Substances Act. This made some hemp-derived CBD products with less than 0.3 percent THC federally legal. However, CBD products containing more than 0.3 percent THC still fall under the legal definition of marijuana, making them federally illegal but legal under some state laws. Be sure to check state laws, especially when traveling. Also, keep in mind that the FDA has not approved nonprescription CBD products, and some products may be inaccurately labeled.TakeawayIt’s always a good idea to talk with a doctor before beginning a new treatment regimen, whether conventional or alternative. This will help minimize potential complications. If your goal is to feel better, incorporating these practices into your anxiety treatment plan may be helpful.')]"
